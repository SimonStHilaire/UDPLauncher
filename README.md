# UDPLauncher
Let you launch a process by sending a UDP message

# Configuration
Edit "config.json" to define the messages and their respective commands. The working directory will be set to the executable's directory.

# Troubleshooting
Be sure that the data can go through the port (defender?)
For anything else, you have the source code :)
